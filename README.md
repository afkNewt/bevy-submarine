This project so far is an implementation of the marching squares algorithm and Sebastian Lague's cave generation algorithm, with the ability to destroy terrain by hovering over it with the cursor.

Eventually I plan to have the player piloting a submarine in these randomly generated caves, with the ability to mine through terrain in order to get to their destination.
